# Coursera-Capstone-Project
This holds all the files I completed as part of my Space X project, which was a guided project with IBM as part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate on Coursera.

Data is collected from the Space X API alongside webscraping Wikipedia articles. Various techniques are used for exploratory data analysis, including the creation of a python dashboard to showcase visualizations. The end goal is to use the data and wrangle it to accurately predict whether Falcon 9 rocket launches will be successful based on a large variety of features and the usage of different ML algorithms and metrics.

Each of the major steps are split up in it's own notebook, and all relevant libraries/packages are installed in each notebook if you would like to rerun the notebooks. There is also extra code that is commented out that you may have to uncomment to properly access the data.
